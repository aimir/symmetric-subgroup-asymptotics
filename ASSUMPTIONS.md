# Mathematical inputs and computational evidence

Read with the [mathematical statements](SPEC.md) and
[external input register](provenance/LITERATURE.md).

## Mathematical assumptions

The argument uses ordinary finite group theory, linear algebra and analysis,
together with the external theorems identified in the input register. The
capacity, fusion, mixed-family, transport and exhaustion statements of this
project are mathematical components of the argument, not additional external
axioms.

The primitive results used in the c=1 application include classification-based
inputs. The argument is not claimed to be CFSG-free. Binary action coverage,
nonbinary transitive classification and primitive classification have distinct
scopes.

Every application of an external bound retains its actual group action,
faithful degree, normality and coefficient-field hypotheses. An abstract
quotient need not inherit the faithful permutation degree of its source.
The source list distinguishes journal articles from public preprints and
states the precise attribution where a result is quoted through another paper.

## Finite witnesses and coverage

Three mathematical assertions have different meanings:

1. Local soundness: acceptance of the serialized permutations, maps and
   inequalities implies the stated property of that finite witness.
2. Coverage: every action and normal subgroup in the theorem's quantified
   domain is represented, with valid transport under permutation conjugacy.
3. Evaluation: a specified checker accepts the particular supplied data.

GAP/Python checks provide computational evidence about the supplied witnesses.
A PASS message, file digest or collection of correct examples does not establish
coverage or a formal theorem. An action catalogue's completeness also does not
by itself establish the completeness of a normal-subgroup enumeration.

The complete binary-menu checker supplies explicit evidence for both coverage
claims: all transitive index-two kernels from Sylow wreath roots and all
central-involution extensions from the trivial normal. The mathematical
closure arguments are in the [binary schema](certificates/schema/binary_menu.md).
Its verifier uses literal permutations and GAP algorithms, without catalogue
queries or `NormalSubgroups`. Catalogue completeness remains a separate input
for the nonbinary and primitive ranges listed in the literature register.

The other finite packages specify their own completeness evidence in the
[certificate inventory](certificates/README.md). Nonbinary normal menus use
class-normal joins; pair-top and four-block menus use intersections of actual
irreducible kernels. The primitive/rank checker and the affine-nine constructor's small local
groups instead use GAP's normal-subgroup algorithm for those lists. Constructive block
coverage and catalogue-based coverage are kept distinct. Exact cyclotomic
characters, conjugacy, presentations and normalizers remain GAP computations.
The zero-ternary frames use complete GAP normal menus for their top groups and
stabilizers, an independent binary cyclic-sum closure for the eight-block
module lattices, and explicit odd-subgroup and normalizer witnesses in the
sixteen-block cases. The primitive frame domains use PrimGrp completeness;
the 29 imprimitive tops have a separate constructive coverage proof.

For the four exceptional charts, the data retain maps alpha:U->Q and beta:P->Q
onto the same specified quotient, with exact kernels and unchanged physical
degree. The degree-16 image is the actual proper subgroup
P<C4 x D8^3; replacing it by the full direct product changes the joint
relations. Simultaneous full-preimage transport keeps all correlated outside
coordinates. Its general weighted estimate is distinct from a finite inverse
check.

A supplied set of normalizer generators proves only a lower bound for the
normalizer order unless completeness is separately established. Exact action
weights use the normalizer in the original symmetric group, not an abstract
automorphism-group order.

The binary menu retains full symmetric normalizers for every action node;
the checker computes their equality with GAP's normalizer algorithm. The
separately pinned base alphabet fixes the actual carrier colours, rather than
allowing substitution of any actions satisfying the same numerical budgets.

The [certificate documentation](certificates/README.md) and
[local computation documentation](computations/README.md) specify the scope
of each supplied check. These computations do not constitute Lean verification.
