# Lean formalization

The local project pins Lean **4.30.0** and mathlib commit
`c5ea00351c28e24afc9f0f84379aa41082b1188f`. Its complete dependency graph is
recorded in `lake-manifest.json`. With elan installed, run from this directory:

```sh
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

The first command obtains mathlib's precompiled objects; the second checks
this project's proofs. Cached dependencies allow the build to run offline.
There are no CI workflows.

## Statements and explicit benchmarks

[Statements.lean](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/Statements.lean) defines the
three targets in [SPEC.md](../SPEC.md):

| Declaration | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `T1` | Exponential relative accuracy of the exact coefficient benchmark. |
| `T2` | Relative `O(1/n)` accuracy of the exact positive-saddle expression. |
| `T3` | The elementary four-periodic expression, with its explicit first correction and `O(n^(-1/2))` remainder. |
| `DefinitionChecks` | Finiteness, the Gaussian counting identity, positivity, saddle existence/uniqueness, and convergence obligations. |
| `AllTargets` | The conjunction of `DefinitionChecks`, `T1`, `T2`, and `T3`. |

All declarations use the namespace `SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics`.
The three asymptotic targets are propositions to prove; defining them does
not establish them.

The binary factor in `exactBenchmark` and `saddleBenchmark` is the explicit
rational expression

    G_r = sum_(k=0)^r product_(i=0)^(k-1) (2^r - 2^i)/(2^k - 2^i).

`binaryGaussianCoefficient` defines each product, and `binaryGaussianSum`
defines the sum. The empty product is one. Every denominator in the product
is positive. `binarySubspaceCount` is a separate combinatorial object used
in the proof of the counting identity; neither benchmark depends on it.

* `subgroupCount` counts `Subgroup (Equiv.Perm (Fin n))` directly.
* `criticalCoefficient` is the finite rational coefficient sum.
  `parityCoefficient` guards the shifted index before natural subtraction.
* `saddleRadius` is the infimum of the nonnegative upper level set of the
  saddle polynomial. Its positive-root interpretation is proved separately.
  `saddleBenchmark` has its two unused initial values set to one.
* `eulerProduct`, `kappaEven`, `kappaOdd` and `residueConstant` use the exact
  infinite-product/theta definitions. Their convergence and positivity must
  be proved; default values of divergent sums cannot substitute for them.
* `elementaryBenchmark` is the explicit `M_n`, with `M_0 = 1`.
  `firstCorrection` subtracts in the reals, retaining the negative correction
  in even degree. Fractional exponents and analytic divisions are real.

Each target quantifies its constants before `n`, so the bounds are uniform in
parity and residue class. `Targets.lean` proves equivalence with the single
common threshold in Section 5 of the specification. `AllTargets` requires the
definition obligations as conclusions, not hypotheses.

## Proof modules

| Module | Mathematical content |
|---|---|
| [Foundations](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/Foundations.lean) | Finite counts, positive Gaussian products and coefficients, exact-benchmark positivity and initial values. |
| [GaussianCount](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/GaussianCount.lean) | Double counting independent tuples by their span proves the exact Gaussian formula for every dimension, then for all subspaces. |
| [Saddle](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/Saddle.lean) | Positive root existence and uniqueness, identification with the specified infimum, variance bounds and benchmark positivity. |
| [Constants](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/Constants.lean) | Euler-product convergence and positivity, theta summability, and positive residue constants and elementary benchmark. |
| [DefinitionsVerified](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/DefinitionsVerified.lean) | Assembles every field of `DefinitionChecks`, including the counting identity, without added hypotheses. |
| [Recurrence](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/Recurrence.lean) | Eventual row contraction gives boundedness first; scalar and row decay then transfer to error bounds. |
| [Targets](SymmetricSubgroupAsymptotics/Targets.lean) | Equivalence of the separate and common-threshold formulations. |

The abstract recurrence results retain their kernel and counting hypotheses;
they do not establish a subgroup asymptotic without those estimates.
The [verification boundary](../ASSUMPTIONS.md#formal-theorem-boundary)
distinguishes conditional assembly, proofs relative to named published inputs,
and closed theorems. The main asymptotic targets T1, T2 and T3 remain unproved
in Lean.
